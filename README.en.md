# Dell-Inspiron-7590-Hackintosh-Opencore
OpenCore EFI for Dell Inspiron 759x.        
✅ Current macOS version: `10.15.5 Beta 2` `(19F62f)`  / Current EFI version: `20.5.3`      
In theory, this EFI supports for all models of Dell Inspiron 7590 / 7591 Series.

# Introduction
* The EFI for reference only in present. All hardware can normally work but wireless card have not been tested yet.
* The EFI is based on @[tctien342](https://github.com/tctien342/Dell-Inspiron-7591-Hackintosh)'s repo. Thanks!
* The EFI has included the latest source code of `WhateverGreen` (`1.3.8`) ,it solved the problem on the Sharp SHP14C7 4K screen. Now it can boot any version of macOS 10.15 without binary patches.
* Differences between `config.plist` & `config-1080P.plist`: Comparing to `config-1080P.plist`, the former has been removed two strings - `device-id` & `AAPL,ig-platform-id` to ensure that 4K screen will be normally driven and avoid some problems such as graphics glitch or stuck on booting. Therefore, `config.plist` is fit for 4K model and `config-1080P.plist` is fits for 1080P model.
* [⚠️ **IMPORTANT**] **Default strategy for Bluetooth & WIFI**: <br> The default settings are loading `IntelBluetoothFirmware` and put each kexts for Broadcom Wireless Card into `\OC\Kexts` folder but **disabled** it in `config.plist`. <br>If you have replaced a Broadcom one, goto `config.plist -> Kernel -> Add` to enable them and disable `NullEthernet.kext`. In addition, goto `config.plist -> ACPI` to disable `SSDT-RMNE`. 
* Version number is same as the date of each commit. (e.g. `20.3.6` is the version which updated on 2020/3/6)

# Fix the Combojack Support
Execute `install.sh` in folder `ComboJack` to install an combojack protecting process, so that your computer can make response when you plug in an audio device automatically.
Thanks to @[hackintosh-stuff](https://github.com/hackintosh-stuff/ComboJack) and @[tctien342](https://github.com/tctien342).

# Color Profiles for 4K Screen
It will load the default sRGB color profile. For 4K model, it is an incorrect profile but you can apply other color profiles for your screen to improve the color experience.
> Download: ([Sharp SHP14C7](http://oss.pm-z.tech/temp_files/SHP14C7_ICC.zip)) ([AUO AUO41EB](http://oss.pm-z.tech/temp_files/AUO41EB_ICC.zip))<br>Each package includes all 6 profiles which are extracted from Dell PremierColor. <br>Copy .icm files to `~/Library/ColorSync/Profiles` and apply the color profile you need in `System Preferences→Displays→Color`.<br>Using `Adobe RGB` or `DCI-P3` profile is recommended, due to the 4K screen covers 100% Adobe RGB and 90% DCI-P3.

# Fn function may be changed
`Fn Function` may be changed after upgrading to macOS `10.15.5`.
For example, the hotkey to dim the display is `F6`, which will be changed to `Fn + F6` after upgrading the macOS to `10.15.5`. Meanwhile, pressing `F6` seperately it will work as an normal function key.
This change will effect on other operating systems, including Windows.
If you need to turn the function key mode to initial status, set it in BIOS: Go to `POST Behavior → Fn Lock Options`, then select `Lock Mode Enable/Secondary`.

# Known Problems
- [x] ~~HDMI can't output audio on 4K model.~~
- [x] ~~Audio Card sometimes not working if mac installed in fast NVME drive, due to the loading order of `AppleALC` & `AppleHDAController`.~~
- [x] ~~A short time sleep with lid-closing will lead to kernel panic.~~
- [x] ~~It won't response automatically when HDMI cable plug out. You have to set it to normal display status manually.~~
    > ~~Temporary Solution: After plug out HDMI cable, hold  `Option` button (`Windows` Button on Hackintosh) on `System Preferences→Displays`, and click button `Detect Displays` to re-detect the monitors.~~
- [ ] HDMI can't output audio on 1080P model.
- [ ] Wireless Card & ThunderBolt have not been tested yet and can't confirm whether they are available.
- [ ] Internal Microphone doesn't work.
- [ ] It can't read proper battery capacity (Should be 97 Wh instead of 85Wh). But the percentage of remaining battery is correct.
    
# What's New
## 2020/2/16
* Generalized this repo for all models of Inspiron 7590 / 7591 Series.
* Added Color Profiles for 4K screen.
## 2020/2/18
Replaced `SMBIOS` from `MacbookPro15,1` by `15,3` and cleaned up SSDTs to reduce the battery consumption. Thanks to @tctien342.
## 2020/2/24
Added `NullEthernet.kext` so that you can test some original macOS application (e.g. `App Store` & `FaceTime`) without a built-in network card.
## 2020/3/6
* Now, HDMI Port can output both of video & audio. 
* Updated `VoodooI2C` and added argument `-btnforceclick` to treat press the trackpad as `Force Click`. Thanks to @tctien342.
* Updated `AppleALC` and added argument `alc-delay=500` to ensure that sound card can be driven at proper time. Thanks to @lvs1974.
## 2020/3/7
Added `IntelBluetoothFirmware` & `IntelBluetoothInjector` again.
> The solution to slow booting due to loading these kexts:<br>Roll back the Intel Bluetooth driver to initial version in `Devices Manager` on Windows. It will roll back the firmware of bluetooth too. New firmware maybe imcompatible with macOS.
## 2020/3/8
* Replaced `VoodooTSCSync` with `CPUTSCSync` to fix kernel panic after wake up from sleep.
* Fixed recognization of HDMI plug-out.
* Modified stolen memory of UHD630 to 3072MB.
## 2020/3/9
Fixed graphics glitch on external screen when using HDMI connection on 1080P model. (Thanks to @Arien for testing)
## 2020/3/25
The macOS has been upgraded to `10.15.4`.
## 2020/4/12
* Upgraded `Opencore` to `0.5.8 (20200410)`.
* Upgraded `WhateverGreen` to `1.3.8`, in order to fix black screen after sleep possibly occur on certain models. (Thanks to @kihsu for testing)
## 2020/4/13
Upgraded `Lilu` to `1.4.3`, which is compatible with `WhateverGreen` (`1.3.8`). (Thanks to @XHL669 & @ChasonJiang for testing)
## 2020/4/17
The macOS has been upgraded to `10.15.5 Beta 2 (19F62f)`.
## 2020/5/3
* Disabled `SSDT-PLUG-_SB.PR00.aml`, in order to make CPU's performance be normal.（PL1 = 45W / PL2 = 90W）
* Upgraded `WhateverGreen` to `1.3.9`, added argument `igfxfw=2` to use Apple GuC Firmware. (GuC = Graphics microController)
